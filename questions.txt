1) What is a variable?
Sonething you store in your programs memory to grab later


2) Are variable names case-sensitive? Is a variable named a the same as a variable named A?
They are case sensitive and no they are not the same.


3) What characters are you allowed to use in a variable name?
letters, underscores and numbers (when not first)



3) Can a variable that originally holds a string hold a different type later on?
yes you can reassign 



4) Can you save the contents of one variable to another? Example:
    x = 5
    y = x
   What is the value of y?
   yes you can and the value of y is now 5 




5) Does using the variable in an operation cause the variable's value to change? How can you cause a variable's value
    to change?
x=5
x+= 20/3 


6) Why do we use variables, what is their purpose?
To store specific things without having to retype them. like instead of saying 20*3/4+3 a bunch of times, we can assign a variable to that expression and just type that. It simplifies code.


7) What is the difference between a literal and a variable?
A literal is what is literally there. like this "hey" but if i made "hey" a varible i could name it bye. It wont literally be bye, because bye is just holding "hey" in there.


8) Why are we allowed to write the code x = x + 5, when in math this would be a contradiction?
because in math we  are usually  solving for the unknown and you cant find the unknown with the unknown as a helper because... umm who are you?? lol, so that definetly wont work.but in python, we already assigned x to something, so we know what x is and can alter it however we choose.
